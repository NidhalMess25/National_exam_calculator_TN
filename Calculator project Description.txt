Project 2 :

Calculator for national exam results
in Tunisia

Description :
We have developed a great calculator for calculating national exam   results in Tunisia using Python Programming language !
Hope you like it :)
1- 6th class :
      The sixth debate consists of five basic tests:
 		-Arabic Language Test : ../20 *1
		-English test : ../20*1
		-French language test : ../20*1
		- Scientific awakening test  : ../20*1
		-Mathematics test : ../20*1

    The calculator will multiply the result of the test by its value and then divide it by the sum of the tests, to get the final result of the debate: ../20

2- 9th class :
      The ninth debate consists of five basic tests:
 		-Arabic Language Test : ../20 *2
		-English test : ../20*1
		-French language test : ../20*1
		- Scientific awakening test  : ../20*2
		-Mathematics test : ../20*2

    The calculator will multiply the result of the test by its value and then divide it by the sum of the tests, to get the final result of the debate: ../20
